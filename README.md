ðŸ“Š Global Superstore Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the Global Superstore dataset to uncover key business insights related to sales performance, profitability, seasonal trends, and customer behavior.
Using Python and popular data visualization libraries, the analysis identifies growth opportunities, operational inefficiencies, and provides data-driven recommendations to improve overall business performance.

ðŸš€ Key Insights & Recommendations
1. Sales Performance & Seasonality
Finding: Sales have shown consistent year-over-year growth (2011â€“2014), nearly doubling in total revenue.
Peaks occur Augustâ€“December, while February and July are the slowest months.

Recommendation:

Targeted marketing during off-peak months to balance demand.

Increase inventory & staffing for peak months to avoid stockouts.

2. Profitability & Discount Strategy
Finding: High discounts have a negative correlation with profits.
Many orders with deep discounts lead to losses.

Recommendation:

Shift to profit-first discounting.

Offer selective discounts on underperforming products, avoid on best-sellers.

Explore bundles and value-added offers instead of large markdowns.

3. Market & Product Focus
Finding:

Top markets: APAC and EU generate the highest sales.

Top cities: New York City & Los Angeles dominate revenue.

Technology drives revenue, Copiers & Phones have the highest profit margins.

Recommendation:

Prioritize marketing in high-performing regions & cities.

Promote high-margin sub-categories to maximize ROI.
