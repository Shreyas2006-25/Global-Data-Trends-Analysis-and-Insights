## ðŸš€ Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Sales Performance & Seasonality
**Finding:** Sales have shown consistent year-over-year growth (2011â€“2014), nearly doubling in total revenue. Peaks occur **Augustâ€“December**, while **February** and **July** are the slowest months.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Targeted marketing during off-peak months to balance demand.  
- Increase inventory & staffing for peak months to avoid stockouts.  

### 2. Profitability & Discount Strategy
**Finding:** High discounts have a **negative correlation** with profits. Many orders with deep discounts lead to losses.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Shift to profit-first discounting.  
- Offer selective discounts on underperforming products, avoid on best-sellers.  
- Explore bundles and value-added offers instead of large markdowns.  

### 3. Market & Product Focus
**Finding:**  
- **Top markets:** APAC and EU generate the highest sales.  
- **Top cities:** New York City & Los Angeles dominate revenue.  
- **Top products:** Technology drives revenue, Copiers & Phones have the highest profit margins.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Prioritize marketing in high-performing regions & cities.  
- Promote high-margin sub-categories to maximize ROI.
